# :dizzy: Project Highlights

### 🧮 Data Analysis：

* Delving further into the realm of feature engineering, I have meticulously implemented feature selection and transformation to bolster the predictive capabilities of my models. My repositories includes a broad array of feature extraction techniques such as variable transformations, interaction feature creation, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. 

* Additionally, I have utilized a range of methods like encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and constructing derived features using domain knowledge. These strategies have significantly enhanced the robustness and efficiency of algorithmic models across diverse data-centric challenges.

* A critical component of my analytical repertoire is the detection and handling of outliers, which can skew results and impede model accuracy. To address this, I've employed the robust algorithms provided by the pyod library, adeptly identifying and prudently managing these anomalies to maintain the integrity of the analysis.

### ⚙️ Machine Learning：
* In the field of machine learning, my expertise is not limited to traditional models like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests for solving classification problems. 

* I have further explored Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) techniques, including XGBoost and AdaBoost, to tackle complex nonlinear problems. 

* SVM optimizes classification boundaries by finding the best hyperplane in high-dimensional space, while GBM enhances model's ability to recognize nonlinear data patterns by iteratively optimizing weak learners, especially when utilizing XGBoost 
and AdaBoost. For model tuning, I use cross-validation and GridSearchCV along with Bayesian Optimization to accurately find the best model parameters. 

* Using models like ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX for predicting time series data, which is crucial for understanding and forecasting stock market trends and sales volumes.

* I have initiated a project focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically aimed at predicting Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types. This project leverages textual analysis to identify personality traits based on users' written expressions

* Finally, by precisely evaluating model performance using tools like confusion matrices, ROC 
curves, and precision-recall curves, I can thoroughly understand the strengths and weaknesses of models, thereby making wiser decisions in real-world problems.

# :gem: Future Goals and Directions

### 🧠 Deep Learning: 
* I have already made initial explorations in deep learning and applied ANN for data analysis and basic use of CNN for image recognition, moreover expect to use LSTM in time series data. 
Currently, I am immensely interested in the innovative applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

### 🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP): 
*  My future goals involve expanding the scope of NLP applications to include sentiment analysis of texts, the development of intelligent recommendation systems, and the creation of interactive chatbots.

*  These advancements will leverage the full potential of language data, enhancing user interaction and delivering personalized experiences based on sophisticated language understanding and processing.
