# 🎼 Classify Song Genres from Audio Data Model 🎤

## 🔍 Project Overview:
* In recent years, streaming services with extensive music catalogs have become the primary way people listen to music. However, the vast selection can be overwhelming for users searching for new tunes that fit their taste.

* To address this, streaming services have employed methods to categorize music for personalized recommendations. One such method analyzes the raw audio data of songs to score various metrics. Today, we'll use a dataset from The Echo Nest to classify songs into 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' categories without listening to any tracks ourselves.
