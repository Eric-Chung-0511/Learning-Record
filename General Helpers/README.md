### üìö Functions Overview 

- #### <a name="plot_random_image"></a>plot_random_image: [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Neural_network_classification.ipynb)
  Display a random image from the dataset along with its label. Useful for data exploration and sanity checks.

- #### <a name="load_and_prep_image"></a>load_and_prep_image: [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)
  Load an image from a file, preprocess it, and prepare it for model prediction. This includes resizing and scaling the pixel values.

- #### <a name="plot_loss_curves"></a>plot_loss_curves: [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)
  Plot the training and validation loss and accuracy curves. Useful for analyzing the performance of the model over epochs and identifying overfitting or underfitting.

- #### <a name="pred_and_plot"></a>pred_and_plot: [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)
  Make a prediction using the model and plot the image with the predicted class as the title. Useful for visualizing model predictions in an intuitive way.

- #### <a name="unzip_data"></a>unzip_data: [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)
  Unzip a specified zip file into the current working directory. This function takes a file path to a zip file, extracts all its contents, and saves them in the current directory.

- #### <a name="view_random_image"></a>view_random_image: [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)
  This function view_random_image is used to randomly select and display an image from a specified directory and class. It first sets up the target folder, then randomly selects an image from the target folder, reads the image, and plots it using matplotlib. The title of the image is set to the target class name, and the shape of the image is also displayed.
