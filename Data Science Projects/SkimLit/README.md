## Project Purpose and Origin

The primary purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of automatically classifying and summarizing biomedical literature. This helps researchers quickly access relevant information from vast amounts of scientific papers. The project leverages the universal-sentence-encoder-4 from TensorFlow Hub and builds a Thribird model to achieve this goal.

Initially, the project experimented with BERT for the classification task. However, the final implementation using the universal-sentence-encoder-4 achieved a higher accuracy.

This project is inspired by the need to efficiently process and extract meaningful insights from biomedical literature, as highlighted in the paper ["Smarter than BERT? A Low Resource Model for Biomedical Sentence Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03841).
