## General Helpers ðŸ”‘
This folder contains various helper functions. The Python files include both the code and explanations. If you want to see these functions in action, please check out the examples. ðŸš€

### Functions ðŸ’Ž

- **plot_confusion_matrix**: Visualize the customized confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of classification models. Helps in identifying misclassifications and understanding model accuracy. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/plot_confusion_matrix_example.ipynb)

- **plot_random_image**: Display a random image from the dataset along with its label. Useful for data exploration and sanity checks. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Neural_network_classification.ipynb)

- **load_and_prep_image**: Load an image from a file, preprocess it, and prepare it for model prediction. This includes resizing and scaling the pixel values. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)

- **plot_loss_curves**: Plot the training and validation loss and accuracy curves. Useful for analyzing the performance of the model over epochs and identifying overfitting or underfitting. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)

- **pred_and_plot**: Make a prediction using the model and plot the image with the predicted class as the title. Useful for visualizing model predictions in an intuitive way. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)
