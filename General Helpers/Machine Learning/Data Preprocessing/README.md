### Handle outliers using pyod([View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Loan%20Prediction/Loan%20Prediction%20_Eric.ipynb))
- This module consists of three functions aimed at handling outliers in your dataset.
- **detect_outliers**: Handle outliers using pyod.
- **find_best_threshold**: Find the optimal contamination threshold for outlier detection models using cross-validation based on F1 scores.
- **combined_outliers**: Combine outlier detection results from multiple models using strategies such as 'union' or 'intersection' for robust analysis.
