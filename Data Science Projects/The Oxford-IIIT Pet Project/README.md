## üöÄ Project Details:

### üß† Model Exploration and Selection:
## **Model Testing with ResNet-50:**
- Utilizing the **ResNet-50 model** for its proven track record in image classification tasks, known for its ability to learn deep hierarchical features from images.
- **ResNet-50** addresses a common issue in deep networks: when networks become very deep, gradients can either explode or vanish during backpropagation, making training difficult. To solve this, ResNet-50 introduces a key innovation called the **Residual Block, which allows the network to "skip" certain layers, preserving information and stabilizing training in deep architectures.**
- ResNet-50 was chosen due to its balance between depth and computational efficiency, making it suitable for training on the Oxford Pet dataset while delivering strong classification performance.
- Transfer learning allowed us to fine-tune the pretrained ResNet-50 model on the Oxford Pet dataset, adapting its learned features to accurately classify 37 different pet breeds.

### üñ•Ô∏è Deployment:
**Final Model Deployment:**
- The fine-tuned ResNet-50 model was deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, making it accessible for real time predictions.
- **Users can upload images of pets to receive predictions about their breed, showcasing the practical application of transfer learning and real time image classification.**

### ‚öôÔ∏è  Technical Implementation:

#### Data Handling and Preprocessing:
- Pandas was used for managing and cleaning the dataset, while Matplotlib was utilized for visualizing image data distribution and model performance.
- The data preprocessing steps included resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset to improve model generalization.
- These steps ensured that the model could handle diverse inputs and improve its robustness when predicting new images.

#### Transfer Learning:
- Transfer learning played a critical role in this project. By leveraging a pretrained ResNet-50 model, its capability can quickly build an effective image classifier by fine-tuning the model on a smaller dataset, significantly reducing training time while improving accuracy.
  
- **To fine-tune the model, I froze most of the ResNet-50 layers except for the last 4 layers (layer4 is the last Conv2d layer)**. This allows the model to retain its general image features while focusing on learning the specific features for pet classification. The following code was used to implement this fine-tuning strategy:

- In addition, **I adjusted the learning rate and optimizer to further improve the model's performance.** I used the **AdamW** optimizer with weight decay for regularization and the **OneCycleLR** scheduler to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training:

- This fine-tuning approach and learning rate adjustments helped to optimize the model's learning process and achieve a higher accuracy on the Oxford Pet dataset.


#### Interactive Interface with Gradio:
- Gradio was integrated to provide an intuitive and user friendly interface where users can upload images and instantly get breed predictions.
- This interface highlights the model's potential for real world applications, offering an accessible way to interact with machine learning models without needing to write code.

## üéØ Conclusion:
**Oxford Pet Classifier** showcases the power of transfer learning in reducing the time and computational resources required for training deep learning models.
- The decision to use ResNet-50 underscores the importance of model selection in balancing performance and efficiency, particularly for real world applications.
- The deployment on Hugging Face Spaces with a Gradio interface makes the model accessible to the public, demonstrating how deep learning models can be utilized in real world scenarios.

## üåê Try it Yourself:
