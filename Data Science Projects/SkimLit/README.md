## Project Purpose and Origin

The primary purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of automatically classifying and summarizing biomedical literature. This helps researchers quickly access relevant information from vast amounts of scientific papers. 

This project is inspired by the need to efficiently process and extract meaningful insights from biomedical literature, as highlighted in the paper ["Smarter than BERT? A Low Resource Model for Biomedical Sentence Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03841).

Waiting for update more details~
