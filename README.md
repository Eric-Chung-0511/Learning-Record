<h2 id="star2-why-data-science">🌟 Why Data Science</h2>

In this era of vast and ever-growing data, AI and data science combine disciplines like statistics, data analytics, machine learning, and particularly **deep learning**, to uncover hidden patterns and insights by processing large datasets. These technologies allow us to build models that learn from data, enabling intelligent predictions, decisions, and innovative applications.

What excites me most is the potential of **deep learning** to go beyond predictions and create **real-world innovations and intelligent tools**. The ability to use this technology to build smarter systems that can transform daily life, whether by improving convenience or enabling entirely new solutions, drives me to master the core techniques behind it and make a meaningful impact in this data-driven and AI-powered world.

<h2 id="dizzy-data-science-projects">💫 Data Science Projects</h2>

The [Projects folder](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects) contains a collection of my hands-on work across various domains of machine learning and data science. These projects reflect my practical application of data science concepts, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning and deep learning.

Here are three highlighted projects that showcase different aspects of my skills:

* 🐾 **[PawMatchAI](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/PawMatchAI)** – A deep learning project for dog breed classification with over **13k+ GPU Runs and 33k+ visits**, and was featured in Hugging Face's **"Spaces of the Week"** for its strong user engagement and real-world utility.
It combines **ConvNeXtV2**, **Multi-Head Attention**, and a **morphological feature extractor** to accurately classify 124 breeds, and uniquely offers a **sophisticated recommendation system** to suggest the most compatible match based on detailed lifestyle preferences and breed characteristics.
The project demonstrates advanced problem-solving by implementing **knowledge distillation techniques** to address challenging breed distinctions and integrating **contrastive loss functions** to enhance model robustness against visually similar breeds.

* 🛰️ **[Vision Scout](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/VisionScout)** – A sophisticated multi-modal computer vision system that orchestrates **YOLOv8, CLIP, Places365, and Llama 3.2** through intelligent fusion architecture. The system transcends traditional object detection by integrating environmental scene classification, semantic context analysis, and advanced natural language generation to transform visual data into comprehensive narrative descriptions. Vision Scout performs **spatial mapping, functional zone identification, lighting analysis, and activity inference** while maintaining factual accuracy through structured LLM enhancement processes. The platform supports both static image analysis with detailed scene interpretation and foundational video processing capabilities for temporal object tracking.

  The project has accumulated **10k+ visits** and **4k+ GPU runs** in three months on Hugging Face.
  Recognition as a featured project in Hugging Face's **"Spaces of the Week"** demonstrates its innovative approach to bridging computer vision and natural language understanding for practical applications.


* 💳 **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection)** - A traditional machine learning project tackling highly imbalanced data to detect fraudulent transactions. Using advanced techniques like **ADASYN** sampling and **XGBoost** with **Bayesian hyperparameter optimization**, this project achieved a **99% AUC score**, showcasing my skills in data preprocessing and model evaluation.

Each project represents a step towards honing my skills and deepening my understanding of how data can be used to solve real world problems.
