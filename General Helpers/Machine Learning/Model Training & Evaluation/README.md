#  ðŸ“š Function Overview

### plot_confusion_matrix([View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/plot_confusion_matrix_example.ipynb))
Visualize the customized confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of classification models. Helps in identifying misclassifications and understanding model accuracy.

### Bayesian Optimization([View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Loan%20Prediction/Loan%20Prediction%20_Eric.ipynb))
- **This function consists of several functions and steps aimed at optimizing and training a RandomForestClassifier using Bayesian optimization and handling imbalanced data with SMOTE.**
- **objection**: Objective function for Bayesian optimization to optimize RandomForestClassifier parameters.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Process to find the best hyperparameters for the RandomForestClassifier.
- **Pipeline Creation**: Create a pipeline with SMOTE and the optimized RandomForestClassifier for handling imbalanced datasets.

### find_optimal_k([View Document](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Machine%20Learning/Model%20Training%20%26%20Evaluation/find_optimal_k.py))
- **This function consists of a single function aimed at finding the optimal number of clusters for KMeans clustering using the Elbow Method.**
- **find_optimal_k**: Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sum of squared errors (SSE) against the number of clusters.

### evaluate_models([View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Music%20Genre/Music%20Classification_Eric.ipynb))
- **This function consists of one main function aimed at evaluating multiple classifiers using cross-validation.**
- **evaluate_models**: Evaluate multiple classifiers using stratified k-fold cross-validation and return a DataFrame containing the evaluation results, including mean train accuracy, mean test accuracy, and cross-validation errors.

### plot_roc_curve([View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Loan%20Prediction/Loan%20Prediction%20_Eric.ipynb))
- **This function consists of one main function aimed at plotting the ROC curve for a given model and test data.**
- **plot_roc_curve**: Plot the ROC curve for a trained classifier, compute the AUC, and display the curve with the AUC value, providing a visual representation of the model's performance.
