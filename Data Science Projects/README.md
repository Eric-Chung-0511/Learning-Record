<h2 id="data-analysis">üìä Data Analysis</h2>

My journey in data science began with foundation in statistics and exploratory data analysis. I've always believed that understanding the data deeply is critical before applying any sophisticated algorithm. Through visualization and statistical analysis, I've consistently uncovered insights that guide my modeling approaches and feature engineering strategies.

When working with complex datasets, I've found that thoughtful feature engineering often contributes more to model performance than algorithm selection alone. In my projects, I've developed expertise in various transformation techniques, from basic variable scaling to more complex methods like PCA for dimensionality reduction. I particularly enjoy creating interaction features that capture relationships between variables ‚Äì something that often leads to significant performance gains in models.

One of the most challenging aspects of real world data science is dealing with imbalanced datasets, especially in domains like fraud detection where the events of interest are rare. To address this, I've implemented both **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** and **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)** in multiple projects. These techniques have proven invaluable for creating synthetic examples that help models better learn the patterns of minority classes without simply oversampling existing points.

Outlier detection has also been a focus area for me, as anomalies can significantly impact model performance. I've utilized the robust algorithms in the **PyOD library** to detect and handle outliers in ways that preserve the integrity of the analysis while acknowledging their potential importance in certain contexts.

<h2 id="supervised-machine-learning">‚öôÔ∏è Supervised Machine Learning</h2>

My approach to supervised learning has evolved from implementing simple models to developing sophisticated ensembles that combine multiple algorithms' strengths. I find it fascinating how different models capture different aspects of the same problem, and how combining these perspectives often leads to more robust predictions.

I've worked extensively with classification algorithms ranging from traditional methods like **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees** to more complex approaches such as **Support Vector Machines** and ensemble methods. The **Random Forest** algorithm has been particularly valuable in my work, especially for its ability to handle high-dimensional data while providing insights into feature importance.

Gradient Boosting frameworks like **XGBoost** have become central to many of my projects due to their remarkable performance and efficiency. What I appreciate most about these boosting methods is how they systematically improve predictions by focusing on the errors of previous iterations ‚Äì a principle that extends beyond machine learning into how we learn as humans.

For time series forecasting, I've implemented ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models to predict future values while accounting for seasonality and external factors. In my [Walmart Sales Prediction](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Walmart%20Sales%20Prediction) project, these models helped forecast sales volumes across different store locations while considering seasonal patterns and promotional events.

Model tuning is where science meets craft in machine learning. I've developed a systematic approach to hyperparameter optimization using both grid search and Bayesian optimization techniques. The latter has become my preferred method for complex models with many parameters, as it intelligently explores the parameter space rather than exhaustively testing all combinations.

<h2 id="unsupervised-machine-learning">üîç Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2>

Unsupervised learning represents one of the most intriguing areas of machine learning to me ‚Äì the ability to discover hidden structure in data without predefined labels. There's something almost magical about watching algorithms reveal patterns that weren't immediately obvious to human observers.

In my [E-Commerce project](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/E-Commerce), I applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing transactional data using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics, I was able to identify distinct customer groups with specific behavioral patterns.

I implemented **K-Means clustering** combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant features. What I appreciate about K-Means is its interpretability ‚Äì the cluster centers provide clear reference points that business stakeholders can easily understand, making the insights actionable for marketing teams.

For handling more complex data structures, I explored **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), which excels at identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and distinguishing outliers as noise. This approach proved particularly valuable for identifying unusual customer behaviors, that didn't fit the typical patterns information that could be just as insightful as the main clusters themselves.

The project reinforced my understanding that choosing the right clustering algorithm depends heavily on the data structure and business objectives. By evaluating both methods using silhouette scores and visual analysis, I was able to determine which approach provided the most meaningful customer segments for this particular e-commerce dataset.

Beyond this specific application, I've found that dimensionality reduction techniques serve not just as preprocessing steps, but as valuable tools for understanding high-dimensional data. Visualizing complex datasets in lower dimensions often reveals relationships that wouldn't be apparent in the original feature space.

<h2 id="deep-learning">ü§ñ Deep Learning</h2>

Deep learning has become my primary area of interest and expertise, particularly in computer vision applications. The ability of neural networks to learn hierarchical features from raw data continues to fascinate me, and I've dedicated significant time to understanding both the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of these powerful models.

My flagship project in this area is [PawMatchAI](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/PawMatchAI), a dog breed classifier that achieves an **88.7% F1 score across 124 different breeds**. Built and trained on over 21,000 images, this model has been deployed as a functional application on Hugging Face Spaces, complete with features for breed comparison and personalized recommendations.

What makes this project special is the architecture, rather than using an off-the-shelf **CNN**, I designed a hybrid system combining modern backbone networks with **attention mechanisms** and a custom **Morphological Feature Extractor**. This biologically-inspired approach mimics how humans recognize objects by identifying distinctive shape patterns and structural features.

The Morphological Feature Extractor works alongside traditional convolutional layers and transformers to focus on the most discriminative morphological characteristics of each breed ‚Äì elements like ear shape, snout length, and coat texture that are critical for distinguishing between visually similar breeds. By integrating these complementary systems, the model can better capture both fine-grained visual details and broader structural patterns that traditional CNNs might struggle to identify consistently.

This hybrid architecture significantly improved performance on challenging cases, such as differentiating between closely related breeds that share similar coloration but differ subtly in physical structure. The results demonstrate how combining deep learning techniques with biologically-inspired design principles can enhance computer vision systems for fine-grained classification tasks.

The journey of developing PawMatchAI taught me as much about the engineering aspects of deep learning as it did about the theoretical concepts. From data preprocessing and augmentation to model deployment and optimization, each step presented unique challenges that pushed me to deepen my understanding of the entire deep learning pipeline.

<h2 id="natural-language-processing">üìù Natural Language Processing</h2>

While computer vision remains my primary focus, my curiosity has led me to explore natural language processing through several projects. The parallels between how models process visual and textual information ‚Äì both involving hierarchical feature extraction and context awareness ‚Äì have given me a broader perspective on deep learning as a whole.

In my [SkimLit](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/SkimLit) project, I fine-tuned a **RoBERTa** model to classify and summarize sections of biomedical research papers. This application addresses a real world need: helping researchers quickly extract relevant information from vast amounts of scientific literature. Working with transformer architectures gave me appreciation for how attention mechanisms revolutionized NLP by capturing long-range dependencies in text.

I've also explored more traditional NLP approaches in my [MBTI Prediction](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/MBTI%20Prediction) project, where I combined feature engineering methods like **TF-IDF** with gradient boosting models to predict personality types from text samples. This project highlighted the importance of thoughtful text preprocessing and feature extraction, even when working with sophisticated algorithms.

These explorations into NLP have broadened my machine learning toolkit and given me valuable experience with text data processing ‚Äì skills that complement my computer vision expertise and open the door to potential multimodal applications in the future.

<h2 id="future-directions">üöÄ Future Directions</h2>

As I continue my journey in AI and machine learning, I'm particularly excited about several emerging areas that I'm actively exploring:

  - Transfer learning has already transformed how we approach deep learning tasks, but I believe we've only scratched the surface of its potential. I'm currently investigating more sophisticated fine-tuning techniques that can better adapt pre-trained models to specific domains with limited labeled data. The ability to leverage knowledge from one task to accelerate learning in another mirrors how humans learn, making this area both practically useful and intellectually fascinating.

  - The rapid advancement of large language models like **GPT-4** and Meta's **Llama 3** presents incredible opportunities for practical applications. I'm particularly interested in exploring how these models can be fine-tuned for specialized domains or integrated into larger systems that combine symbolic reasoning with neural approaches. The challenge of harnessing their capabilities while mitigating their limitations provides a rich space for innovation.

  - Perhaps most exciting to me is the frontier of multimodal learning ‚Äì systems that can process and reason across different types of data such as images, text, and potentially audio. I envision building applications that could automatically extract key information from research papers, not just from the text but also from figures, tables, and equations. Such tools could dramatically accelerate scientific research by making knowledge more accessible and connections between studies more apparent.

<h2 id="my-project-workflow">üîÑ My Project Workflow</h2>

Through experience across various projects, I've developed a systematic [data science workflow](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Data%20Science%20Project%20WorkFlow.md) that guides my work from initial problem definition through data collection, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

This documented approach ensures consistency across projects while allowing for the iterative nature of data science work, where initial findings often lead to refined hypotheses and improved models. By breaking complex problems into manageable components and establishing clear metrics for success at each stage, I maintain both rigor and flexibility throughout the development process.
