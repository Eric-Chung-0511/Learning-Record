### 📚 Functions Overview 

- **plot_random_image**: Display a random image from the dataset along with its label. Useful for data exploration and sanity checks. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Neural_network_classification.ipynb)

- **load_and_prep_image**: Load an image from a file, preprocess it, and prepare it for model prediction. This includes resizing and scaling the pixel values. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)

- **plot_loss_curves**: Plot the training and validation loss and accuracy curves. Useful for analyzing the performance of the model over epochs and identifying overfitting or underfitting. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)

- **pred_and_plot**: Make a prediction using the model and plot the image with the predicted class as the title. Useful for visualizing model predictions in an intuitive way. [View Example](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/General%20Helpers/Examples/Convolutional_neural_networks_in_tensorflow.ipynb)
