<h2 id="data-analysis">üìä Data Analysis</h2>

I started my journey in data science by getting hands-on with statistics and exploratory data analysis. Before jumping into any modeling, I‚Äôve always believed it‚Äôs worth spending time just looking at the data ‚Äî figuring out what‚Äôs missing, what looks odd, and where the patterns might be hiding.

In practice, I often spend more time cleaning and shaping the data than building the model itself. I've come to realize that a well-prepared dataset usually leads to better results, even with simpler algorithms.

One area I‚Äôve invested time in is **feature engineering**. Whether it's scaling variables, reducing dimensionality, or crafting new interactions, I try to shape the data in a way that makes sense to both the model and the business context. Some common techniques I use include:

- **Scaling** (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) to bring features to a similar range  
- **PCA** when dimensionality is high and interpretability is less of a concern  
- **Interaction features** when variable combinations seem to hold predictive power  

Working with real world data also means dealing with **class imbalance**, especially in cases like fraud detection. For this, I‚Äôve used techniques like:

- **SMOTE** to generate synthetic minority class samples  
- **ADASYN**, which focuses more on harder-to-learn examples  
These methods often make a noticeable difference, especially in improving recall for rare classes.

I also pay close attention to **outliers**, which can silently skew both training and evaluation. Depending on the situation, I usually go with:

- **IQR-based filtering**, to identify and isolate extreme values.This method typically defines outliers as values falling below Q1 - 1.5 √ó IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 √ó IQR, where IQR = Q3 - Q1.   
- **Quantile trimming**, which is more aggressive but sometimes necessary  
- **Log transforms**, especially for right-skewed features  
- **Median imputation**, to preserve rows while softening the impact of anomalies  

I don‚Äôt apply these methods blindly, I tend to explore different approaches, compare how they affect the data, and choose the one that fits best. There‚Äôs no perfect recipe, but being deliberate at this stage usually pays off later.

<h2 id="supervised-machine-learning">‚öôÔ∏è Supervised Machine Learning</h2>

I started with the basics models like logistic regression and decision trees, just to get a feel for how algorithms make decisions. Over time, I moved toward more complex techniques, not just to chase accuracy, but to understand how different models "see" the same data in different ways.

One thing I‚Äôve learned is that no single model captures everything. I‚Äôve worked with a range of classifiers, including:

- **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì straightforward and easy to explain. I still use it when interpretability matters, or as a quick baseline to understand feature relationships.

- **Decision Trees** ‚Äì fast to train and surprisingly effective on tabular data. I sometime start with them to explore how the model is splitting and whether the features are doing their job.

- **Support Vector Machines** ‚Äì powerful when the data is clean and the classes are well-separated. Tuning the kernel and C values can be tricky, but the results are often worth it when you get them right.

- **Random Forest** ‚Äì a solid all-rounder. I like using it when I want some level of interpretability (through feature importance) but also want the robustness of an ensemble.


In many projects, I‚Äôve leaned heavily on **gradient boosting**, especially **XGBoost**. I like how boosting doesn‚Äôt try to get everything right at once ‚Äî instead, it builds on the mistakes of previous iterations. That incremental mindset feels very intuitive to me, and it‚Äôs often delivered strong results even on noisy datasets.

For time series tasks, I‚Äôve used models like **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **SARIMAX**. In the [Walmart Sales Prediction](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Walmart%20Sales%20Prediction) project, those helped me forecast sales by accounting for seasonality and promotional events across different stores. It reminded me how important it is to think beyond just the numbers, context like holidays or local events can make a big difference.

When it comes to model tuning, I‚Äôve tried a lot of approaches, but these two are the ones I return to most often:

- **Grid Search** ‚Äì brute-force, but dependable. I use it when the parameter space is small and I want to try all combinations. It's simple to implement, but gets expensive quickly as dimensions grow.  
  _(Behind the scenes, it‚Äôs basically testing every possibility. For smaller models, that‚Äôs fine ‚Äî but on larger ones, it becomes painfully slow.)_

- **Bayesian Optimization** ‚Äì smarter and faster in many cases. It uses probability models (like Gaussian processes) to estimate where the best parameters might be, then focuses search in those areas.  
  _(It doesn‚Äôt test everything ‚Äî it *learns* where to look.) I usually use libraries like [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) or [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) for this. They tend to find good results with far fewer iterations._ 

The latter has been especially useful in fine-tuning complex models where I want smarter exploration rather than brute force.

At this stage, I don‚Äôt just look at accuracy anymore, I think about the tradeoffs, the model‚Äôs interpretability, and how well it fits the problem. Sometimes a simple model that aligns with the business goal is more valuable than a complicated one that no one trusts.

<h2 id="unsupervised-machine-learning">üîç Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2>

Unsupervised learning has always felt a bit like exploration work, looking for hidden patterns without knowing exactly what to expect. There‚Äôs something rewarding about seeing structure emerge from raw data, especially when the results challenge your assumptions.

In my [E-Commerce project](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/E-Commerce), I used clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. I applied **RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), which helped me frame customer activity into measurable dimensions. Even before modeling, that alone gave some intuitive insights.

To group similar customers, I started with **K-Means**, paired with **PCA** to simplify the feature space. K-Means isn‚Äôt perfect, but I like its simplicity ‚Äî the cluster centers are easy to interpret, which makes it easier to communicate results to non-technical stakeholders like marketing teams.

Later on, I also explored **DBSCAN**, which takes a very different approach. Instead of assigning every point to a cluster, it allows for "noise" ‚Äî points that don‚Äôt belong anywhere. That turned out to be helpful for spotting customers with very atypical behavior, the kind that might otherwise skew averages or confuse the model.  

Both methods gave me something useful, but in different ways. To choose between them, I looked at **silhouette scores** and also just plotted the clusters. I‚Äôve learned that visual intuition still plays a big role, sometimes charts tell you more than metrics alone.

More broadly, I‚Äôve found that **dimensionality reduction** techniques like PCA or t-SNE aren‚Äôt just for preprocessing, they‚Äôre great for understanding. Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D often reveals relationships you wouldn‚Äôt catch from raw tables or correlations alone.

<h2 id="deep-learning">ü§ñ Deep Learning</h2>

My focus in deep learning is on architecting and building robust, end-to-end systems that solve tangible problems. I believe in a full-stack approach: from designing novel architectures and advanced training strategies to deploying interactive, user-centric applications. This philosophy is best demonstrated by my two flagship projects.

### Flagship Project: VisionScout ‚Äî A Multi-Modal Scene Understanding System

My main system-level project, [**VisionScout**](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/VisionScout), is designed not just to see objects, but to understand the entire story within an image. It orchestrates a **multi-modal fusion of YOLOv8, CLIP, Places365, and Llama 3.2** to generate a rich, human-like narrative of a scene, complete with spatial analysis and inferred activities. This novel architectural approach earned the project a feature in **Hugging Face‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpaces of the Week.‚Äù**

### Deep-Dive Project: PawMatchAI ‚Äî High-Accuracy Specialized Classification

Complementing the system-level integration of VisionScout, [**PawMatchAI**](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/PawMatchAI) showcases my expertise in developing highly specialized and accurate models. This dog breed classifier, trained on over 21,000 images, reaches an **F1 score of 88.7%** and was also featured in Hugging Face‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpaces of the Week.‚Äù More than just a classifier, it was developed into a full application with user-centric features like breed comparison and personalized recommendations.

### My Technical Approach

My approach combines robust system architecture with innovative, domain-specific modeling to solve complex problems. This philosophy is reflected in the unique technical designs of my flagship projects.

* **For VisionScout: System Architecture & Multi-Modal Fusion**
    * The core of VisionScout is a **dynamic multi-modal fusion engine**. Instead of relying on a single model, it intelligently **orchestrates** insights from specialized models (YOLOv8 for objects, CLIP for context, Places365 for scenes).
    * An **LLM (Llama 3.2)** is integrated at the final stage to synthesize the structured data into a coherent, human-like narrative, moving beyond simple tags to genuine understanding.
    * The entire system is built on a **scalable, modular architecture** using the Facade Design Pattern, which allows for high maintainability and the ability to easily integrate new analytical components in the future.

* **For PawMatchAI: Domain-Specific Model Innovation**
    * To solve the fine-grained classification challenge, I designed a **custom Morphological Feature Extractor**. This hybrid architecture is inspired by how human experts identify breeds by structural traits (e.g., ear shape, snout length), allowing the model to learn beyond simple textures.
    * High performance was achieved using **advanced training methodologies**, including a progressive unfreezing strategy for the ConvNeXtV2 backbone and a combination of specialized loss functions (like Contrastive and Focal Loss) to handle visually similar breeds.

Through these projects, I've gained hands-on experience across the full deep learning pipeline. My primary goal is to build intuitive and useful AI applications that bridge the gap between complex models and real-world users, viewing high accuracy as a critical means to that end.

<h2 id="natural-language-processing">üìù Natural Language Processing</h2>

While computer vision remains my primary focus, my curiosity has led me to explore natural language processing through several projects. The parallels between how models process visual and textual information ‚Äì both involving hierarchical feature extraction and context awareness ‚Äì have given me a broader perspective on deep learning as a whole.

In my [SkimLit](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/SkimLit) project, I fine-tuned a **RoBERTa** model to classify and summarize sections of biomedical research papers. This application addresses a real world need: helping researchers quickly extract relevant information from vast amounts of scientific literature. Working with transformer architectures gave me appreciation for how attention mechanisms revolutionized NLP by capturing long-range dependencies in text.

I've also explored more traditional NLP approaches in my [MBTI Prediction](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/MBTI%20Prediction) project, where I combined feature engineering methods like **TF-IDF** with gradient boosting models to predict personality types from text samples. This project highlighted the importance of thoughtful text preprocessing and feature extraction, even when working with sophisticated algorithms.

These explorations into NLP have broadened my machine learning toolkit and given me valuable experience with text data processing ‚Äì skills that complement my computer vision expertise and open the door to potential multimodal applications in the future.

<h2 id="future-directions">üöÄ Future Directions</h2>

As I continue building my skill set in AI and machine learning, there are a few areas I'm especially drawn to ‚Äî not just because they‚Äôre trending, but because they align with how I think about learning, adaptability, and cross-domain understanding.

- **Transfer Learning**  
  This has already changed how we approach deep learning problems. Instead of training from scratch, we build on existing knowledge. I'm particularly interested in more advanced fine-tuning methods that help large models adapt to smaller, specialized domains. The challenge is making them flexible without overwriting what‚Äôs already valuable ‚Äî a balance that‚Äôs surprisingly tricky.

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
  I‚Äôve been following the progression from GPT-4 to Llama 4 with a lot of interest. Beyond generation tasks, I‚Äôm curious about how LLMs can be tailored for specific domains, or integrated into pipelines that involve reasoning, retrieval, or symbolic logic. There‚Äôs real potential here, but also important questions around alignment, efficiency, and trust.

- **Multimodal Learning**  
  This is the area I‚Äôm most excited about. Combining different types of input ‚Äî such as text, images, and potentially audio. Unlocks possibilities that go well beyond what single-modality models can achieve. I‚Äôd love to build tools that can read a paper and not only understand the text, but also interpret the accompanying charts, tables, and images. It feels like a meaningful step toward making complex knowledge more accessible and better connected.

<h2 id="my-project-workflow">üîÑ My Project Workflow</h2>

Across different projects, I‚Äôve gradually shaped a [data science workflow](https://github.com/Eric-Chung-0511/Learning-Record/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Data%20Science%20Project%20WorkFlow.md) that helps me stay organized ‚Äî from framing the problem, to collecting and cleaning data, to building and evaluating models.

I like having a structure, but I also know things change as insights emerge. This workflow keeps my process consistent without getting in the way of iteration. By breaking big problems into smaller steps and setting clear goals along the way, I‚Äôve found it easier to stay focused while still leaving room to explore and improve.
